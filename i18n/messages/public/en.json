        {
          "question": "What is Base64 encoding?",
          "answer": "Base64 is an encoding method that uses 64 printable characters to represent binary data. It's commonly used to transmit binary data like images and files in text protocols. Base64 encoding ensures data integrity during transmission."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do we need Base64 conversion?",
          "answer": "Base64 encoding is mainly used for: 1) Transmitting binary data in text protocols; 2) Embedding files in HTML, CSS, JSON and other text formats; 3) Avoiding special character escaping during transmission; 4) Transmitting file data in certain API interfaces."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are the tools secure?",
          "answer": "Yes, our tools are completely secure. All conversion operations are completed in your browser, data is not uploaded to servers. We do not collect, store or transmit any of your data, completely protecting your privacy and security."
        },
        {
          "question": "What file formats are supported?",
          "answer": "We support multiple formats: text (UTF-8 encoding support), images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.), PDF documents, JSON data, XML data, Excel files (xlsx, xls), hexadecimal (Hex) data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there file size limits?",
          "answer": "Different tools have different recommended limits: images max 100MB, PDF max 50MB, other formats recommended not to exceed 10MB. These limits are mainly to ensure good user experience and browser performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are the tools free?",
          "answer": "Yes, all tools are completely free to use. We don't charge any fees and don't require account registration. You can use all features without restrictions."

        },
        {
          "question": "Does Base64 encoding increase file size?",
          "answer": "Yes, Base64 encoding typically increases file size by about 33%. This is a normal phenomenon in the encoding process, and the original size is restored after decoding. This increase ensures data can be safely transmitted in text protocols."
